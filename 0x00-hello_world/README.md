# Hello, World
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering at ALX-Africa. It aims to learn about the basic commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

## Environment

* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04.01 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 9.40
* Style guidelines: Betty style

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename | Description
--- | ---
0-preprocessor | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file
1-compiler | Compiles a C file to an object file with the object file name same as the C input file name but with a .o extension instaed of .c
2-assembler | Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it to an output file with same name as the C filename by with a .s extension instead
3-name | Compiles and creates an executable file with the name cisfun simultaneously
4-puts.c | A simple C code that prints text to the stdout with 'puts' function
5-printf.c | Using the printf function to print text to the stdout
6-size.c | Printing the size of various data types in C dependent on the machine its beign compiled and run on
100-intel | Generates assembly code from C using 'Intel syntax'
